The “moonlight sonata” might well be the composer’s most popular work, though it is only the first movement that garners that fame.  One generally thinks of the first movement as a romantic night piece, although it may well hold another darker mood. The last movement is a generally quiet perpetual motion work with moments of impassioned outburst; and the middle movement is a minuet and trio.
