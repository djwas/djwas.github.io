Horowitz, like Liszt, was one of the greatest pianists of all times.  Some consider him to have been the greatest pianist.  The focus of “greatest pianist” here, I believe is on his pianism not his musicianship: Though he was a great musician.  His fame, I believe, was based on his unique mastery of the technique required to draw a wide variance of color and sound from the instrument, and for his amazing yet to be duplicated agility, color, sound, and composure at the instrument.  Not to mention that he played more concerts than you could shake a stick at!  And across the globe to boot!

Horowitz immigrated to the United States and in 1942 became an American citizen.  He was a patriot of this great country.

The main technical challenges of this arrangement are strength, agility about the keyboard, finger independence (especially the small fingers of the right hand) fast mental imagining, leaps, huge handfuls of notes, and did I say power!  The left hand, while rapidly leaping long distances over the keyboard, must set the fingers in air and grab sounds without hesitation.  In many instances the performer is unable to view the many physical motions as they occur at the extreme ends of the keyboard simultaneously.  Many times the fingers must simply “do the walking” out of sight, but the walking must be clear in the minds eye.  Getting tired is not an option.  As a past pedagogue would say, “One must be a trooper!”  In this case to march!

This Horowitz arrangement of the “Stars and Stripes” was recorded in 1950 and it was a signature piece and a called upon encore during his very lengthy career.
